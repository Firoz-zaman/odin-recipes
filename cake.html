        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                 Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease and flour a cake pan.</li>
            <li>Step 2
                 In a bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Step 3
                 Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Step 4
                 Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Step 5
                 In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Step 6
                 Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, alternating with milk, until smooth.X</li>
            <li>Step 7
                 Pour the batter into the pan and bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Step 8
                 Let the cake cool, then slice and serve as is — or frost if desired.</li>
